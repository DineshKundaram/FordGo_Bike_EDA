# Ford GoBike Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes the Ford GoBike bike-sharing system data from the San Francisco Bay area to answer:

## How long does the average trip take?
Is trip duration affected by weather (months/seasons)?
Does it depend on user type (subscriber or customer)?

## Key Findings
### Average trip duration: ~11 minutes (Customers: 17 minutes, Subscribers: ~10 minutes).
### Weather impact: Minimal based on synthetic data; real data needed.
### User type effect: Customers (especially women/unknown genders) take longer trips; Bike Share for All increases Subscriber durations.
### Revenue: Customers earn $1.72/trip, Subscribers $0.50â€“$0.56/trip, with Subscribers contributing more total revenue.

### Recommendations
Attract more Customers (especially women) with discounts for longer rides.
Convert Customers to Subscribers for steady revenue.
Expand Bike Share for All with targeted promotions.
Use real timestamp data to manage bike availability
